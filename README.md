# piranhaNET
Typescript user interface for [piranha](https://github.com/polio-nanopore/piranha) on desktop and web.

### :wrench: This is a work in progress. :wrench:

We will provide a Typescript front end for piranha, which can be built and distributed as an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) 
application, or deployed as a web application.

This monorepo contains the following components in its directories. See the READMEs in each directory for more details:

* `piranha-electron` - source for the Electron application

## Quick start

Run the Electron app with: `./scripts/run-electron`
